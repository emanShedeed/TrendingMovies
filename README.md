# I have some updates regarding my project. The following are the major points:

1. I have implemented clean code, modularization, dependency injection, dependency inversion, separation of concerns, and all the SOLID principles.

2. In terms of functionality, I have completed all the required tasks. The application works in both online and offline modes. It checks if the data exists locally, fetches it if it does, and fetches it from the online repository if it doesn't. Then, it stores it locally. Also, I have implemented the search functionality using genre and/or search text fields for more accuracy.

3. I have added a small example of the unit test part, but it is not fully complete due to time constraints. However, it can give an idea of the way I follow when writing unit tests.

4. Lastly, I have used MVVM-C with RXSwift as the design pattern. I understand that the task should have been done using SwiftUI/Combine, but I mentioned during the technical interview that I am still in the early stages of learning SwiftUI. Therefore, I prioritized showcasing my skills in writing clean code. I hope this is not a big issue.
